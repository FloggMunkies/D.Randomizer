# D.-Randomizer
 DK64 Randomizer Tool

	I built this to test out some ideas I had for a tool that could "solve" a DK64 run that has been randomized, by taking the settings, 
	and moves aquired and checking them against the game logic to output which Golden Banana Check would be ideal to complete first.

	The idea is to use this tool in place of notetaking to track: Moves aquired, Collectibles Aquired, What places you have already checked, and hints.
	There are 2 main tabs to the app, Logic and Map. The Logic tab lets you mark which moves and collectibles you have aquired, what levels are open, 
	and what settings you are playing with. The Map tab displays the levels of the game, and all of the available checks you can do within them.

	The Map updates whenever something in the Logic tab is changed. So when you collect a new move, new areas may be opened up to you allowing you to check
	for new bananas. Checks that are available are highlighted, and ones that are not are greyed out. Once you have completed a check and received your reward,
	you can click on the check to turn it into a checkmark so you know you finished it.

	Sometimes you can see the reward to a check without actually completling the challenge. Perhaps you checked out Lanky's Caged Banana on K. Lumsy's Island
	and saw that it was a Key. Above each check, there is dropdown box with all of the items, allowing you to quickly note what is at any given check.

	Within this dropdown you can also select a secondary type of highlighting for Green, Yellow or Red, denoting "Need", "May need", or "Do not need".
	This comes in handy when you receive one of Wrinkly Kong's hints. If he tells you that the rewards in the Aztec Oasis are foolish, you can easily
	Highlight all of them Red to remind yourself to not go there.
	

	This is also my first foray into Godot, so everything is a bit messy.
